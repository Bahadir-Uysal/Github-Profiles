# Github Profiles
## My project shows the github profiles I entered in the search section as a card on the screen and shows the last 5 repos of these profiles. When it cannot find the user, it gives an error message. 
### The other thing I did was to use axios instead of the fetch api, which was quite a new experience for me.
